# salary_employee_retention
Using RStudio, my team and I explored the effect salary has on the probability of leaving a company. The dataset we used is a simulated dataset of 14,999 observations (employees) from Kaggle. We explored the potential causal relationship by creating various DAGs and testing the models using Gradient Boosted Tree algorithm, generalized linear models, ridge regression, LASSO regression, random forest, neural networks, and K-nearest neighbors. Our preliminary analysis showed that, given certain assumptions, higher salaries reduces employee attrition.
